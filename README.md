# Income-and-Expense-Tracker
 The Income and Expense Tracker project aims to create a simple command-line tool that allows users to keep track of their income and expenses. The program will prompt the user to enter income transactions and expense transactions, providing a description and amount for each. It will then calculate the total income, total expenses, and net savings for the user.
